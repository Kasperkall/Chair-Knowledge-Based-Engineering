# Knowledge-Based Engineering Project 

This project is a part of the course TMM4275 Knowledge-Based Enineering, Project. The main task is making an automatic KBE system for manufacturing a coustom chair. From taking the client's order, checking if the order is within the constraints set by a product engineer, then making a model of the chair and ordering it from the factory.
The customar should be able to specify different sizes and shapes for the different parts of the chair, making their own custom chair. 

This project is made by: 
* Kasper Kallseter
* Magnus Myklegard
* Amalie Berge Holm
